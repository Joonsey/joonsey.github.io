## Welcome to my GitHub page

I'm Johannes I was born in Trondheim, Norway. I am now 18 years old and i'm an aspiring software developer who likes to program, been learning ``` python ``` for a while and like to work in it.
Made some funny small projects like a [keybot](https://joonsey.github.io/Keybot/), and [flappybird!](https://github.com/Joonsey/FlappybirdAi) (with an integrated NEURAL NETWORK AI) with lots more to come.

### Why python?

Python is easy to learn and very comprehensible, and was by far the best choice to learn as a beginner.
It's also easy to find documentation and usefull modules from other people and use them.

### Have you done any large scale projects?

Not yet, but i like to work on some intertemdiate projects like neural network flappy bird and socketing (i.e server and client hosting).
Although most of repositories are private as of now i'll publish more as i see them improve and become more comfortable with publishing them.

I have done some html and set up a website on a local host, but as i have moved into a new flat i haven't port forwarded my port yet so i am unavailable to host the server as of now. front-end is developed with ```html``` and ```css```, and back end is entirely made with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) module in python.

### Do have any other hobbies?

Yes, i play World Of Warcraft somewhat competetively, [my character](https://raider.io/characters/eu/argent-dawn/J%C3%A6nn%C3%A4)

I have a Steam library of around â‰ˆ600 games.

I also play most other competetive games on a level.
