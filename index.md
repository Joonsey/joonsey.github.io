## Welcome to my GitHub page

I'm Johannes I was born in Trondheim, Norway. I am now 18 years old and i'm an aspiring software developer who likes to program, been learning ``` python ``` for a while and like to work in it.
Made some funny small projects like a [keybot](https://joonsey.github.io/Keybot/), and [flappybird!](https://github.com/Joonsey/FlappybirdAi) (with an integrated NEURAL NETWORK AI) with lots more to come

### Why python?

Python is easy to learn and very comprehensible, and was by far the best choice to learn as a beginner.
It's also easy to find documentation and usefull modules from other people and use them.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Joonsey/joonsey.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
